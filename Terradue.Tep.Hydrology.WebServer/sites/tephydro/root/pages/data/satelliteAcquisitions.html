		<p>EO missions providing data contributions to the CEOS Seismic Hazards and Volcano Pilots are listed below. The contribution can be in the form of specific data acquisition campaigns to make sure appropriate observations will be available over the pilot areas or access to data for generating EO based measurements. Each CEOS member providing a contribution concerning an EO mission is responsible for data access. Furthermore space agencies are providing access to EO data collections in the framework of the GSNL initiative. The platform  geobrowser allows to display relevant collections to support the geohazards community.</p>

Managed by ESA, the Space Component is in its pre-operational stage, serving users with satellite data currently available through the GMES Contributing Missions at national, European and international levels. Copernicus will become operational after launch of the first Sentinel mission. ESA is developing five families of Sentinel missions Sentinel-1 to Sentinel-5. Sentinel-1A is a polar-orbiting, all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services. It will be used to support the CEOS Pilot on Seismic hazards. Specific data sets will gradually be made available over selected areas of the GSNL and over specific areas for tectonic analysis such as strain rate assessment. Data provision will be in line with the Copernicus Data Policy under preparation by the European Union and other corresponding data policies.</p>">

						<p>COSMO-SkyMed (Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation) is a 4-spacecraft dual-use constellation, conceived by ASI (Italian Space Agency) and funded by the Italian Ministry of Research and the Italian Ministry of Defence. Each of the four satellites is equipped with a X-band SAR instrument operating at 9.6 GHz, capable of operating in all visibility conditions (all-weather and night/day conditions) at high resolution and with interferometric/ radargrammetry capability. The primary mission is to provide services for military and civil (institutional, commercial) community for land monitoring, territory surveillance, management of environmental resources, maritime and shoreline control, law enforcement, topography as well as scientific applications.</p>

						<p><strong>Type:</strong> LANDSAT 8 has two main sensors: the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS).</p>
						<p>OLI collects images using nine spectral bands in different wavelengths of visible, near-infrared, and shortwave light to observe a 185 kilometer (115 mile) wide swath of the Earth in 15-30 meter resolution covering wide areas of the Earth's landscape while providing sufficient resolution to distinguish features like urban centers, farms, forests and other land uses.</p>
						<p>TIRS was added to the satellite mission when it became clear that state water resource managers rely on the highly accurate measurements of Earth's thermal energy obtained by LANDSAT 5 and LANDSAT 7, to track how land and water are being used.</p>

						<p>More specifically, EO-1 has validated a multispectral instrument that is a significant improvement over the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument; has validated a hyperspectral land imaging instrument and the unique science that can be performed with hyperspectral data; and has validated the ability of a low-spatial/high-spectral resolution imager that can correct systematic errors in the apparent surface reflectances caused by atmospheric effects, primarily water vapor.</p>

						<p><strong>Launch dates:</strong> Pleiades 1A (17 December 2011), 1B (2 December 2012).</p>
						<p><strong>Type:</strong> VHR Optical (panchromatic 0.7m and multispectral 2.8 m at nadir).</p>
						<p>The Pléiades system consists of two satellites. The two satellites are phased opposite one another to enable daily revisits to any point on the globe. The Pléiades system was designed under the French-Italian ORFEO program (Optical &amp; Radar Federated Earth Observation). The Pléiades programme was initiated in October 2003 with CNES (the French space agency) as the overall system prime contractor and EADS Astrium as the prime contractor for the space segment. It is operated by Airbus Space and Defence. Pleiades imagery comes in a full range of resolutions from 2 m down to 0.5 m (Panchromatic) for work on local scale for mapping the densest urban areas and for other precision applications (monitoring disaster areas, mining or oil exploration, maritime surveillance, agriculture, etc.). Pléiades’ stereo and tri-stereo capability makes it possible to generate DEM products with a 1-metre or 4-metre posting, ideal for 3D modelling of urban areas and relief.</p>
