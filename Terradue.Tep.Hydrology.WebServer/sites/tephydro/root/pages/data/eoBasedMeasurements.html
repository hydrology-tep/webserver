			<strong>EO-based Measurements:</strong> processed results from various tools and software, which once generated are value-added information derived from EO measurements, as presented under <a href="#!pages/data/eoBasedMeasurements">Information Processing</a>.
		</p>	
	<br/>
	<p>
		Different types of EO based products can be generated using satellite EO, for instance:
		<ol>
			<li>high resolution global strain rate model (GSRM) at high spatial resolution incorporating deformation constraints from GNSS and InSAR. InSAR allows essentially continuous observations of the seismic belts worldwide with near-uniform quality.</li>
			<li>new regional or global maps of active visible faults, incorporating the latest results from the geomorphological analysis of high resolution optical imagery and digital topography data.</li>
			<li>new global seismic hazard map based on 1 and 2.</li>
			<li>terrain deformation products around volcanoes in states of unrest.</li>
			<li>rapid response products for volcanoes and earthquakes.</li>
		</ol>
