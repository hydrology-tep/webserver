		<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>Water quality and access is essential for socio-economic development and for maintaining healthy ecosystems. Properly managed water resources are a critical component of growth, poverty reduction and equity. The livelihood of the poorest are critically associated with access to water services. The World Economic Forum identified consequently in its Global Risks 2013 report water supply crises among the top two most impactful, and top five most likely global risks.</p>
	<p>The worldwide 263 trans boundary watersheds cover 60% of the land surfaces and groundwater basins. These water systems, that know no boundaries, produce food through irrigation, support industry and electricity generation, provide freshwater, and sustain ecosystems such as wetlands. Globally, trans boundary watersheds are not sustainably used, suffer from pollution and are affected by trans boundary and national governance issues. Demographic pressure and variability caused by climate change are increasing the demand and competition for reliable freshwater provision. A collective management of trans boundary watersheds would address these challenges and help to ensure a sustainable use of these water systems. Unfortunately national hydrological networks have been degraded globally but specifically in the developing world. Information essential for a sustainable water resources management at trans boundary scale are particular sparse due to lack of consistent information systems and limited sharing of data.</p>
	<p>Current existing EO products and applications relevant for water resource management range from catchment characterization, hydrological modelling, flood mapping/forecasting, water quality monitoring, soil moisture assessment, water extent and level monitoring, irrigation services, urban and agricultural water demand modelling, evapotranspiration estimation to ground water management.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The objective of the TEP for Hydrology is to provide scientific and institutional stakeholders and practitioners with a flexible web-based platform to access, explore, and exploit EO-based data and products related to IWRM, to support hydrological science, and streamline exchange of geospatial information and knowledge within the relevant user community. This platform will enable EO information products most relevant for Water Productivity and Vulnerability.</p>
